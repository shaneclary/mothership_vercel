## 🚀 Launch Checklist

### Phase 1: Database Setup (Required for Production)

#### Step 1: Create Supabase Account
1. Go to [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Create a new project (choose region closest to your users)
4. Wait ~2 minutes for project to provision

#### Step 2: Run Database Schema
1. In Supabase dashboard, go to **SQL Editor**
2. Open the file: `src/lib/rewards/database-schema.sql`
3. Copy all the SQL code
4. Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
5. Click "Run" to execute
6. Verify tables created in **Table Editor**

#### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables
1. In Supabase dashboard, go to **Settings → API**
2. Copy your **Project URL** and **anon/public key**
3. Create `.env.local` in your project root:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

#### Step 4: Update Reward Service (Remove Mock Data)
Open `src/lib/rewards/rewardService.ts` and uncomment the real Supabase queries (marked with `// TODO: Implement real Supabase integration`)

### Phase 2: Enable in Navigation

In `src/components/portal-nav.tsx`, line 19, uncomment:
```typescript
// Currently:
// { href: '/portal/rewards', label: 'Rewards', icon: Award },

// Change to:
{ href: '/portal/rewards', label: 'Rewards', icon: Award },
```

### Phase 3: Test Everything

#### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Visit `/portal/rewards` (while logged in)
- [ ] All 5 tabs load without errors
- [ ] Points display shows mock data (1,200 points)
- [ ] Badges show 2 earned badges
- [ ] Activity feed shows recent transactions
- [ ] Level progress bar displays correctly
- [ ] Rewards catalog shows all tiers
- [ ] Navigation link appears in sidebar

#### Integration Testing
Once database is connected:

- [ ] Level up to next tier

### Phase 4: Integration Points

Add these calls throughout your app:

**After Order Completion:**
```typescript
import { PointEvents } from '@/lib/rewards/rewardService'

// In your order completion handler
await PointEvents.onOrderComplete(userId, orderTotal, orderId)
```

**After Referral Completes First Order:**
```typescript
await PointEvents.onReferralComplete(referrerId, newUserId)
```

**After Community Post:**
```typescript
await PointEvents.onCommunityPost(userId, postId)
```

**After Meal Review:**
```typescript
await PointEvents.onMealReview(userId, reviewId)
```

### Phase 5: Optional Enhancements

   - Display next level progress
   - Quick link to rewards page

2. **Notifications**
   - Toast notifications when points are earned
   - Email for level ups
   - Push notifications for badge unlocks

3. **Admin Panel**

   - Create challenges
   - View analytics
   - Manage rewards catalog

4. **Leaderboards** (Optional)
   - Top earners this month
   - Opt-in only for privacy
   - Gamification element

## 💡 Tips for Success

### Start Simple
1. Launch with just **order-based points** first
2. Add community points after a few weeks
3. Gradually introduce challenges and seasonal bonuses

### Make It Fun
- Announce new badges on social media
- Celebrate level-ups with confetti
- Feature top contributors (with permission)
- Create limited-time bonus events

### Monitor & Adjust
- Track redemption rates
- Watch for point inflation
- Adjust rewards based on what's popular
- Add new rewards based on feedback

### Communication
- Email announcing the rewards launch
- Tutorial or walkthrough for new users
- FAQ page about how points work
- Monthly newsletter showing points earned

## 📊 Success Metrics

Track these KPIs:
- **Engagement Rate**: % of users earning points weekly
- **Redemption Rate**: Points redeemed vs. earned
- **Retention**: Users with points vs. without
- **Referrals**: Increase in referral conversions
- **Order Frequency**: Does rewards increase repeat orders?

## 🎯 Reward Value Guidelines

Current setup: **100 points = $1 value**

Example earning rates:
- $100 order = 100 points = $1 value (1% back)
- Referral = 500 points = $5 value
- Community post = 50 points = $0.50 value

At Level 5 (1.25x multiplier):
- $100 order = 125 points = $1.25 value (1.25% back)

This creates a 1-1.25% cashback equivalent, which is competitive with credit cards while building community.

## 🔐 Security Considerations

✅ **Already Implemented:**
- Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
- Users can only see their own data
- Point transactions are logged and auditable
- Server-side point validation

⚠️ **Before Launch:**
- Review RLS policies in Supabase
- Test with different user accounts
- Add rate limiting for point events
- Monitor for abuse patterns

## 📞 Need Help?

- Review `src/lib/rewards/README.md` for detailed docs
- Check Supabase logs for database errors
- Look at browser console for client-side errors
- Test with mock data first (works without database)

## 🎉 You're Ready!

The entire rewards system is built and ready to launch. You can:

1. **Test immediately** - Visit `/portal/rewards` to see the UI with mock data
2. **Launch when ready** - Just set up Supabase and uncomment the nav link
3. **Iterate gradually** - Start with basic features, add more over time

The foundation is solid, scalable, and follows best practices. Good luck with the launch! 🚀
